# Project Summary
Mint Classics Company, a renowned retailer specializing in classic model cars and vehicles, decided to explore the closure of one of their storage facilities. To ensure a well-informed decision, they sought data-driven insights on inventory management while upholding their commitment to timely customer service. 

~ The objective is to maintain a 24-hour order-to-ship cycle. As a appointed data analyst, I leveraged MySQL Workbench to delve into existing data, profitable opportunities for inventory reduction, and formulate actionable recommendations.

# Approach 
To derive key insights for Mint Classics Inventory Management, we would typically need more detailed data and analysis specific to Mint Classics' operations. Here are some general insights that can be evaluated:

1. **Inventory Holding Costs:** Calculate the costs associated with holding inventory, including storage and insurance. Identifying opportunities to reduce holding costs can increase profitability.

2. **ABC Analysis:** Segment Mint Classics' inventory into categories based on value or importance. This can help prioritize inventory management efforts, with a focus on high-value items.

3. **Lead Time Analysis:** Evaluate the time it takes for Mint Classics to receive inventory once an order is placed. Minimizing lead times can reduce carrying costs and improve customer satisfaction.

4. **Supplier Performance:** Assess the reliability and efficiency of Mint Classics' suppliers in delivering inventory. Monitoring supplier lead times and quality can help identify areas for improvement.
   
5. **Demand Forecasting Accuracy:** Measure the accuracy of Mint Classics' demand forecasts compared to actual sales. Improving forecasting accuracy can prevent excess inventory or stockouts.

6. **Seasonality and Trends:** Identify any seasonal patterns or trends in Mint Classics' inventory levels and sales. Adjust inventory management strategies accordingly to meet changing demand.
  
7. **Slow-Moving Inventory:** Identify items in Mint Classics' inventory that are slow-moving or obsolete. Implement strategies such as discounting or liquidation to minimize losses.

8. **Technology Utilization:** Evaluate the use of inventory management technology, such as inventory tracking systems or demand forecasting software. Investing in technology can improve efficiency and accuracy in managing inventory.

These insights can help Mint Classics optimize its inventory management processes, reduce costs, and improve overall operational efficiency.

# Solutions and Recommendations
The main issue we're tackling is whether to shut down one of the current storage facilities. So, I've identified products with excess inventory, optimized warehouse usage, and adjusted pricing strategies to increase sales. Recognizing valuable customers and evaluating sales team performance will drive efficiency. Analyzing payment trends will improve cash flow management, while assessing product lines aids in portfolio optimization.

Asking the right questions is essential for uncovering valuable insights. By posing targeted queries, we can delve deeper into our data and uncover actionable recommendations to enhance our operations.
- Inventory Optimization:
  
~ Are there products in the inventory with high stock levels but low sales?

• Yes, Some products may have lots in stock but hardly ever get sold. That's where this SQL query comes in. Identify products with high stock levels and low sales using SQL queries.

• Implementing targeted marketing campaigns, discounts, or promotions to boost sales of these products can reduce excess inventory. Additionally, consider adjusting pricing strategies or bundling products to stimulate demand and clear stagnant inventory.

- Warehouse Consolidation:
  
~ Do we need all the warehouses currently in use?

Investigated the necessity of warehouses currently in use and identified those with low or inactive inventory.

• By reallocateing inventory from underutilized warehouses to more active ones, thereby optimizing storage space and reducing operational costs associated with maintaining unnecessary facilities.

• Additionally, by understanding which products are housed in warehouses with low sales activity, Mint Classics can tailor their sales and marketing strategies accordingly.

- Customer Segmentation:

~ Which valuable customers contributing highest sales and highest number of orders?

• Investigated the key contributors to sales and proposes strategies to focus sales efforts on these valuable customers.

• For instance, they can develop personalized loyalty programs or offer exclusive discounts and promotions to incentivize repeat purchases and foster customer loyalty. Additionally, Mint Classics can enhance the overall customer experience by providing exceptional customer service, proactive communication, and seamless transaction processes.

• By continuously monitoring customer behavior and preferences, Mint Classics can adapt their sales efforts and marketing strategies to meet the evolving needs of their most influential customers, ultimately driving long-term customer satisfaction and revenue

- Product Performance Analysis:

~ How do the various product lines stack up in terms of performance?

• Products with high sales-to-inventory ratios indicate efficient inventory management and strong demand, while those with lower ratios may require attention to boost sales or consider removal from the product line.

• Additionally, analyzing total revenue generated allows Mint Classics to assess the profitability of each product line and allocate resources strategically.

# Conclusion
- Conducted a comprehensive review of inventory levels and storage capacity in each warehouse. Identified redundancies and underutilized facilities. Generated a table listing all warehouses and their respective 
  inventory levels. Highlighted warehouses with consistently low or inactive inventory. Investigating the reasons behind the low activity, such as seasonal fluctuations, product demand shifts, or inefficiencies in 
  inventory management. 
- Analyzed sales data to identify top-performing customers based on revenue generated and order frequency. Developed customer profiles to understand their purchasing behavior, preferences, and buying patterns.
- Evaluated the sales performance of each product line based on metrics such as Total sales, Quantity In Stock, revenue generated and Sales to Inventory Ratio. Identified the top-selling products and for 
  underperforming product lines, conduct market research to identify potential reasons for poor sales performance, such as changing consumer preferences or competitive pressures.
