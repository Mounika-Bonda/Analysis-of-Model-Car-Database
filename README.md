# Project Summary
Mint Classics Company, a renowned retailer specializing in classic model cars and vehicles, decided to explore the closure of one of their storage facilities. To ensure a well-informed decision, they sought data-driven insights on inventory management while upholding their commitment to timely customer service. 

~ The objective is to maintain a 24-hour order-to-ship cycle. As a appointed data analyst, I leveraged MySQL Workbench to delve into existing data, profitable opportunities for inventory reduction, and formulate actionable recommendations.

# Approach 
To derive key insights for Mint Classics Inventory Management, we would typically need more detailed data and analysis specific to Mint Classics' operations. Here are some general insights that can be evaluated:

1. **Inventory Holding Costs:** Calculate the costs associated with holding inventory, including storage and insurance. Identifying opportunities to reduce holding costs can increase profitability.

2. **ABC Analysis:** Segment Mint Classics' inventory into categories based on value or importance. This can help prioritize inventory management efforts, with a focus on high-value items.

3. **Lead Time Analysis:** Evaluate the time it takes for Mint Classics to receive inventory once an order is placed. Minimizing lead times can reduce carrying costs and improve customer satisfaction.

4. **Product Vendor Performance:** Assess the reliability and efficiency of Mint Classics' Vendors in delivering inventory. Monitoring Vendor's lead time and quality can help identify areas for improvement.
   
5. **Demand Forecasting Accuracy:** Measure the accuracy of Mint Classics' demand forecasts compared to actual sales. Improving forecasting accuracy can prevent excess inventory or stockouts.
  
6. **Slow-Moving Inventory:** Identify items in Mint Classics' inventory that are slow-moving or obsolete. Implement strategies such as discounting or liquidation to minimize losses.

7. **Product Line Performance** Tracking total quantity sold and revenue generated per product line, serving as key metrics to identify top-performing product lines for strategic optimization and resource allocation.

8. **Technology Utilization:** Evaluate the use of inventory management technology, such as inventory tracking systems or demand forecasting software. Investing in technology can improve efficiency and accuracy in managing inventory.
